# Text Buddy
## Description 

My motivation for this project was to build a simple text editor by using advanced pluggins and apis, sadly I could not get the website to launch through heroku, but I thought I should turn my code in anyways. Constructing a note editor is helpful for many coders as it is a typical interview project. This project helped me learn more about apis, heroku, and node.js. I built this project to test my developer skills. One of the major struggles I had was getting heroku to launch my application without failing. Every time I went to launch the website it failed. When I would fix my error I would launch it again with a new error. If I have time to come back to this repo I will and fix the issues to the best of my ability.
